## Symbolic Regression with PySR

`PySR` is an open source library that allows fitting complex equations that model the given dataset. By achieving a 
mathematical representation of a given dataset, we can contextualize, interpret and simplify our approach to relational
modelling. In case of MacroSim, PySR is being tested as a tool of modelling CPI through the parameters that are tracked
within the simulation engine. If successful, this will allow the creation of a simple, relational expression that is
generated once per distinct run, before the simulation loop begins.
